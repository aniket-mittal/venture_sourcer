# Venture Sourcer

An intelligence platform built for consulting clubs to streamline startup outreach. Find key people at top startups, get their contact information, and generate personalized talking points—all in one place.

## Motivation

Consulting clubs often need to reach out to professionals at startups for networking, client acquisition, or research purposes. This process is typically repetitive and time-consuming:

1. Search for relevant companies
2. Find the right people to contact
3. Research each person's background
4. Craft personalized outreach messages

**Venture Sourcer automates this entire workflow**, reducing hours of manual research to seconds.

## Features

### 🔍 Company Search
Search for companies using natural language prompts like:
- "Fintech companies in NYC with over 50 employees"
- "Healthcare AI startups that raised funding in 2024"
- "Enterprise SaaS companies targeting real estate"

Returns detailed company information including:
- Company name and description
- Industry and location
- Employee count and funding status
- Website and LinkedIn links

### 👥 People Lookup
Find key contacts at any company with:
- **Configurable results** (10, 15, 25, 50, or 100 people)
- **Real email addresses** unlocked via Apollo enrichment
- **Seniority filtering** (founders, C-suite, VPs, directors, managers)
- **LinkedIn profiles** for each contact

### 🔓 Smart Unlocking
Each contact can be "unlocked" to get:
- **Verified email address** via Apollo People Match API
- **Perplexity research** on the individual's background
- **Personalized paragraphs** generated by Claude AI:
  - Why your club is interested in their company
  - Why you specifically want to connect with them

### 📥 CSV Export
Download unlocked contacts with all their information:
- Name, email, phone, title, LinkedIn
- Personalized company interest paragraph
- Personalized person interest paragraph
